        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This shakshuka for one is for those days when you need a break from breakfast cereal, and crave something
             that will sustain you for most of the day, while making you feel very happy and satisfied. By all means,
              serve this with bread so that you can mop up every bit of the tomato, pepper, and mushroom sauce, along
               with the delicious, hopefully somewhat runny, yolk.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 button mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sliced red onion</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sliced hot peppers and/or sweet peppers</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato puree or sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water, or more as needed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese, divided</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 pinch Aleppo chili flakes (optional)</li>
            <li>sliced bread to serve alongside</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to a small pan or skillet.</p>

        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Place mushrooms in a single layer in the skillet, and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Top with onions, 
            then peppers, and another pinch of salt.</p>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Place on medium high heat, and wait for mushrooms to start sizzling. Cook until bottoms of mushrooms 
            are nicely browned, about 3 minutes, and then stir everything together and cook for 1 minute more. </p>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Add cumin, paprika, turmeric, oregano, black pepper, and cayenne and cook, stirring, for another 30 to 
            60 seconds. Stir in tomato puree and water, and wait for mixture to simmer. Stir in cilantro, and 
            scatter over half the feta.</p>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Use a spoon to make a well in the center, and transfer in the egg. Reduce heat to medium low, cover, and
             cook until the egg is done to your liking, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Serve immediately topped with Aleppo chili flakes, and the remaining olive oil, feta, and cilantro, with
             bread on the side.</p>
