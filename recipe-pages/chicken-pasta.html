    <h1>Honey Chipotle Chicken Pasta</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Wow, let us talk about fusion! This honey chipotle chicken pasta combines elements of Italian cuisine 
        and Nashville hot honey with flavors from south of the border! Inspired by a famous restaurant, making
         this colorful dish at home lets me tweak it to our familyâ€™s palate. You can make yours spicier by 
         adding more adobo sauce, if you wish.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>ice water, as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from canned chipotle chilies in adobo)</li>
        <li>4 ounces shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen baby peas, thawed</li>
        <li>cilantro sprigs, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup corn tortilla chips, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Toss chicken pieces with lemon juice, salt, and black pepper; set aside.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in penne and return to a 
        boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until nearly tender and still firm to the bite, 
        about 11 minutes, or about 1 minute less than package directions. Use a slotted spoon to remove the 
        penne from the water and set aside.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>To the boiling pasta water, add asparagus and boil until bright green and tender, 1 to 2 minutes. 
        Use a slotted spoon to remove asparagus and immediately place into a bowl of ice water to stop the 
        cooking process. Add asparagus to the same container as the penne.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>While pasta is cooking, heat butter and olive oil together in a large, nonstick skillet over medium 
        heat, until butter stops sizzling.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Add chopped red pepper, yellow pepper, and onion, and cook, stirring, until onion begins to turn 
        translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in minced garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
        Remove cooked vegetables from the skillet and set aside.</p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>To the same skillet, add chicken pieces and cook, browning chicken on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. 
        Stir in honey, coating all chicken pieces.</p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>Add bell pepper mixture back to the skillet, and stir well. Mix in adobo sauce, heavy cream, and 
        shredded Parmesan cheese. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>Add cooked penne and asparagus and frozen green peas. Stir well. Heat for 3 to 4 minutes, then 
        remove from heat and allow to stand, 3 to 4 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 9</h4>
    <p>Garnish with fresh cilantro and corn tortilla chip pieces, and serve warm.</p>
